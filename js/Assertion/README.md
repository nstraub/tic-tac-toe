# [Assertion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertion_(software_development))

Assertion (specifically, [run-time assertion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertion_(software_development)#Assertions_for_run-time_checking)), is a form of [validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_validation), which throws an [exception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling) rather than modifying state. In other words, it causes the program to fail instead of marking [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing)) as invalid.
